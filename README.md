# Scraping Conventions Project

This project seeks to analyze the language used during the RNC and DNC conventions of 2020. We will scrape and store the full transcripts of both conventions, which were four nights long each. The data collected will be saved in eight separate text files, and then analyzed to compare the language used by the two parties.
